    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Detailed Risk Overview</h2>
    
    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #2c3e50;">Hidden SSID (00:13:37:A9:D9:90)</h3>
      
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Critical Security Issue: Open Network</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The access point utilizes 'Open' encryption, which means that data transmitted over the network is not encrypted and can be easily intercepted by attackers. Anyone within range can connect without authentication, leading to unauthorized access.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> This can lead to eavesdropping on network traffic, data theft, and unauthorized access to connected devices or resources.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Implement WPA2 or WPA3 encryption to secure the network communication.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Hidden SSID</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The SSID is hidden, meaning it does not broadcast its name in the beacon frames. While this may seem like a security measure, it can lead to users connecting to rogue access points that mimic the hidden AP.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Attackers can leverage this feature by setting up spoofed APs that users may unwittingly connect to, thinking they are connecting to the legitimate network.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider broadcasting the SSID to allow users to see and connect securely. Additionally, educate users on verifying network authenticity.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Signal Strength</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The signal strength of -59 dBm indicates that the network might have limited coverage. While not exceptionally weak, it could be weaker compared to other nearby networks.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Lower signal strength can make the network more susceptible to interception by attackers, especially if located near the perimeter of the coverage area.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> If possible, enhance access point placement to ensure robust coverage or consider using additional access points.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Client-Related Issue: No Clients Detected</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The metadata indicates there are currently no clients connected to the access point, which reduces immediate risks related to client devices.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> While there are no clients now, it is essential to consider how the network behaves when clients join, especially regarding security features like WPS that are currently disabled.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Monitor client connections for unusual activities and ensure that security measures are in place for when clients do connect.</div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #2c3e50;">Hidden SSID (40:3F:8C:84:40:A1)</h3>
      
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Hidden SSID</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The SSID of the network is hidden.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Hiding the SSID does not add significant security but can lead to confusion and a false sense of security. It may also facilitate other attacks like probing.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider making the SSID visible to legitimate users to reduce confusion and encourage secure connections.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Client-Related Issue: No clients connected</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> No devices are currently connected to the WiFi network.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> While this suggests that there are currently no threats through connected devices, it also implies that the network might not be routinely monitored for unauthorized access.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Regularly monitor the network for any unauthorized access attempts, even if no clients appear to be connected.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Hidden SSID</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> Hiding the SSID can lead to increased probing attacks.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Attackers can still discover the network through packet sniffing, and legitimate users may have difficulty connecting.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Best practices recommend keeping the SSID broadcast enabled.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Low Signal Strength</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The signal strength of -61 dBm indicates a weaker signal, especially if clients are far from the AP.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Low signal strength can allow eavesdropping by adversaries outside the intended coverage area, potentially leading to data interception.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Optimize the placement of the AP to enhance coverage and consider upgrading equipment if necessary to improve signal transmission.</div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
