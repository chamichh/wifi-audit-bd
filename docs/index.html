    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Detailed Risk Overview</h2>
    
    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #2c3e50;">Hidden SSID (00:13:37:A9:D9:90)</h3>
      
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Critical Security Issue: Open Network Configuration</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The WiFi access point is configured with no encryption, allowing anyone nearby to connect without authentication.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> This poses a significant security risk as unauthorized users can access the network, potentially leading to data interception, unauthorized access to devices, and misuse of network resources.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Implement WPA2 or WPA3 encryption to secure the wireless network and require authentication for access.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Hidden SSID</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The SSID is not broadcasted, meaning that it is hidden from casual observers.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> While hiding the SSID can deter casual users from trying to connect, it may also encourage more determined attackers to probe for the network, using various tools to discover the network's presence.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider broadcasting the SSID to allow known users to connect easily, while employing strong encryption for security.</div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #2c3e50;">Hidden SSID (20:37:06:62:0E:88)</h3>
      
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Critical Security Issue: Weak Encryption Protocol (TKIP)</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The access point is using WPA PSK with TKIP, which is considered weak and susceptible to various attacks, such as replay attacks or statistical attacks.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> This weakness can lead to unauthorized access to the network, compromising sensitive data and resources.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Upgrade the encryption to WPA3 or at minimum WPA2 with AES to enhance security.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Hidden SSID</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The SSID is hidden, which may give a false sense of security while not preventing determined attackers from discovering the network.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> An attacker can still discover the network through other means, such as monitoring traffic, leading to potential unauthorized access.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider broadcasting the SSID to improve network visibility and security through enhanced monitoring.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Low Signal Strength</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The signal strength of -63 dBm is relatively low, which could impact connectivity and reliability but is also indicative of potential coverage limitations.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Users may face temporary connectivity issues, and low signal also indicates the AP could be farther from users than optimal, increasing the likelihood of interference or attacks when users are connected.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Ensure the access point is optimally located to cover necessary areas with adequate signal strength, potentially repositioning or adding additional access points for coverage.</div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #2c3e50;">Hidden SSID (3A:47:5E:08:93:94)</h3>
      
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Hidden SSID</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The SSID of the access point is hidden, which can lead to confusion among legitimate users and provide a false sense of security.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> While it may discourage casual users, hiding the SSID does not prevent determined attackers from discovering the network. Moreover, it complicates connection for legitimate users.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider whether hiding the SSID is truly necessary. If possible, make the SSID visible to ensure legitimate users can easily connect.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Client-Related Issue: No WPS Enabled</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) is turned off, which is generally a good practice to increase security, but may limit connectivity options for some users.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> While disabling WPS eliminates the vulnerabilities associated with this feature, it may also lead to missed opportunities for easier device connections, particularly for those less familiar with technical configurations. However, it's preferable not to have WPS enabled due to its known security weaknesses.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Keep WPS disabled unless absolutely required for specific devices.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Signal Strength</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The signal strength of -61 dBm indicates the AP is at a reasonable distance from potential clients or obstacles that may interfere with connectivity.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> This signal strength may limit the effective range of the network, possibly leading to a smaller coverage area. It can also provide opportunities for attackers to launch denial-of-service attacks within its effective range.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Monitor the placement of the AP to ensure optimal coverage without unnecessary exposure to potential attackers.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Client-Related Issue: Hidden Network</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The network is configured to be hidden, which can discourage casual users from connecting but does not provide true security.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Hiding the SSID does not protect the network; determined attackers can still discover the network using various tools. It can stress user experience as clients must know the SSID in order to connect.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Assess the necessity of keeping the SSID hidden and evaluate the trade-offs in usability versus perceived security.</div>
