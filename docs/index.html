    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Hidden SSID</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The SSID is hidden, meaning it is not broadcasted to devices scanning for networks.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> While hiding the SSID might deter casual users, motivated attackers can still discover the network through various techniques.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider broadcasting the SSID to make the network more accessible to legitimate users, while ensuring strong security measures are in place.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Signal Strength</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> Signal strength is at -53 dBm, which is relatively strong.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Strong signal strength can be beneficial for clients, but also increases the likelihood of eavesdroppers getting too close to exploit vulnerabilities.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Monitor the physical security of the area to prevent unauthorized access, and use security appliances to detect and mitigate potential threats.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Client-Related Issue: No Clients Detected</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The access point has no clients currently associated with it.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> The lack of clients may indicate that the network is not being used, which could be seen as less attractive to attackers but also suggests potential misconfiguration or lack of awareness.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Regularly check the configuration and consider engaging legitimate users to assess interest in utilizing the network.</div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #2c3e50;">Hidden SSID (20:37:06:62:0E:88)</h3>
      
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Critical Security Issue: Weak Encryption</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The access point is using WPA PSK with TKIP, which is considered outdated and less secure than WPA2 or WPA3 standards.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> If an attacker captures network traffic, they can potentially decrypt it more easily due to the weaknesses in TKIP, risking exposure of sensitive data.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Upgrade the security protocol to WPA2 or WPA3 and use AES encryption to enhance security.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Hidden SSID</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The SSID is hidden, which means it does not broadcast its name, potentially leading to security through obscurity.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> While a hidden SSID can deter casual users from connecting, it does not provide substantial security. In fact, determined attackers can still find hidden networks, and the connection process can make the network more susceptible to detection.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider whether hiding the SSID adds any real security. If not, it may be better to broadcast the SSID to facilitate easier and secure connections.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Signal Strength</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> The signal strength of the access point is measured at -63 dBm.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> This signal strength may indicate that the access point's coverage is limited, which can lead to connectivity issues for clients nearby, or be an indicator that the access point is used in a specific operational area. However, limitations in coverage can also indicate a higher likelihood of unauthorized access from outside the intended operational domain.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Evaluate the coverage area of the access point. If coverage is too limited and valuable traffic travels through it, consider repositioning the access point or adding additional units to ensure secure and strong signal coverage.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Client-Related Issue: Zero Client Devices Detected</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> There are currently no client devices associated with this access point.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Having no clients connected could indicate that the access point is not in use or that it is poorly configured, which could lead to oversight in potential security configurations or operational dependencies.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Regularly verify the configuration of the access point and ensure it is being used as intended. If the access point is meant to serve clients but isnâ€™t, investigate potential reasons and resolve any technical issues.</div>

      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider re-evaluating the necessity of hiding the SSID; use strong, unique passwords along with known encryption methods.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
      <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Exposure Vector: Hidden SSID</div>
      <div><strong>Description:</strong> While the SSID is set to hidden, this only obfuscates the network name but does not fully secure the network.</div>
      <div style="color: #7f8c8d;"><em>Implications:</em> Hidden SSIDs can lead to increased security risks, as attackers can utilize tools to reveal them and may attempt targeted attacks.</div>
      <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider using stronger security measures such as robust firewall policies and network access control.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #3498DB; padding-left: 12px;">
